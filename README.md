# uno-score-keeper
This is a web app that helps you keep scores when playing the [UNO](http://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/uno/index.html) card game.

I developed the app with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to get hands-on experience while learning these technologies.

You can check a live demo of the app [here](https://fedebertolini.github.io/uno-score-keeper/).

## Disclaimer
I am not associated with [Mattel Gamesâ„¢](http://www.mattelgames.com/) whatsoever. This is just an unofficial fan app that you can use when playing UNO.
